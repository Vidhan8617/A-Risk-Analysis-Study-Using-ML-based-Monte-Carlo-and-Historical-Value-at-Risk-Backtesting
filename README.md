# A-Risk-Analysis-Study-Using-ML-based-Monte-Carlo-and-Historical-Value-at-Risk-Backtesting
This project compares Historical VaR and ML-based Monte Carlo VaR for market risk analysis on Indian stock data. Volatility is predicted using a Random Forest model and used in Monte Carlo simulations. Both models are backtested using violation rates and binomial tests.
